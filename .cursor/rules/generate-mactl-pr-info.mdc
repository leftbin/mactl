# Rule: Pull Request Title and Description for Mactl (ask-only)

Purpose: When asked to write a PR title and PR description for mactl, respond with exactly two copyable code blocks — first the title, then the description — without making any repository changes.

This rule is designed for ask mode only. Do not modify files, run commands, or propose edits. Output only the two fenced code blocks described below.

Usage: In Ask mode, invoke explicitly as `@generate-mactl-pr-info` or `@pr-info`.

## How to respond (strict)
1) First block: PR Title
   - Fenced code block with language: `text`
   - Single line only
   - Prefix using Conventional Commits: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `revert`
   - Scope is required and must be component-aware, using a token derived from changed files (examples below)
   - Imperative mood, concise, ≤ 72 characters after the prefix
   - No trailing period

2) Second block: PR Description
   - Fenced code block with language: `markdown`
   - Use the following sections when applicable. Omit any that are not relevant.
     - "Summary": 1–3 sentences describing what this PR does in plain language
     - "Context": Why this change is needed (problem, bug, or goal)
     - "Changes": Bullet list of key changes; group by area if helpful
     - "Implementation notes": Important design decisions or trade-offs
     - "Breaking changes": Clearly call out any breaking behavior and migration steps
     - "Test plan": How this was verified (tests, manual steps, screenshots/links)
     - "Risks": Known risks or rollback plan
     - "Checklist": Markdown checkboxes for docs, tests, backward compatibility
     - Optionally include issue links like `Closes #123` when known

## Title format (exactly)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

- Examples of valid scopes: `cmd`, `cmd/app`, `cmd/bootstrap`, `cmd/bundle`, `cmd/git`, `cmd/keyboard`, `cmd/optimize`, `cmd/zshrc`, `internal/app`, `internal/installer`, `internal/git`, `internal/keyboard`, `internal/bundle`, `internal/cli`, `app/keyboard`, `app/build`, `app/audio`, `app/comm`, `build`, `deps`, `docs`, `readme`, `repo`.

## How to infer the title prefix
- `feat`: Adds a new capability, command, flag, or config that users can opt into
- `fix`: Corrects a bug or regression
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing externally visible behavior
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes (`*.md`, docs)
- `test`: Tests only
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI pipeline/config changes
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes (Makefile, go.mod)
- `chore`: Routine maintenance (formatting, small cleanups) not covered above
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit/PR

Prefer `feat` vs `refactor` based on whether user-facing capability is introduced. Prefer `fix` when the primary intent is to resolve a defect, even if some refactoring was required.

## Scope heuristics (mactl repository)
Determine the `<scope>` from the changed files. Use the most impacted area by lines changed; if multiple, see multi-area guidance below.

- Core Commands
  - `cmd/mactl/root/*.go` → `cmd` or `cmd/<specific-command>` (e.g., `cmd/app`, `cmd/bootstrap`, `cmd/git`)
  - If multiple commands affected → `cmd`

- Command Groups
  - `cmd/mactl/root/app/**` → `cmd/app`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/bootstrap/**` → `cmd/bootstrap`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/bundle/**` → `cmd/bundle`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/git/**` → `cmd/git`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/keyboard/**` → `cmd/keyboard`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/optimize/**` → `cmd/optimize`
  - `cmd/mactl/root/zshrc/**` → `cmd/zshrc`
  - Multiple command groups → `cmd`

- Internal Packages
  - `internal/app/**` → `internal/app` or specific category (e.g., `app/keyboard`, `app/build`)
  - `internal/bootstrap/**` → `internal/bootstrap`
  - `internal/bundle/**` → `internal/bundle`
  - `internal/cli/**` → `internal/cli`
  - `internal/git/**` → `internal/git`
  - `internal/installer/**` → `internal/installer`
  - `internal/keyboard/**` → `internal/keyboard`
  - `internal/lib/**` → `internal/lib`
  - `internal/optimize/**` → `internal/optimize`
  - `internal/zshrc/**` → `internal/zshrc`
  - Multiple internal packages → `internal`

- App Categories (when specific apps are affected)
  - `internal/app/audio/**` → `app/audio`
  - `internal/app/browser/**` → `app/browser`
  - `internal/app/build/**` → `app/build`
  - `internal/app/comm/**` → `app/comm`
  - `internal/app/keyboard/**` → `app/keyboard`
  - `internal/app/mac/**` → `app/mac`
  - `internal/app/network/**` → `app/network`
  - `internal/app/tidy/**` → `app/tidy`
  - `internal/app/tool/**` → `app/tool`
  - Multiple app categories → `app`

- Build and Configuration
  - `Makefile` or `hack/Makefile` → `build`
  - `go.mod`, `go.sum` → `deps`
  - `.gitignore`, `.github/**` → `repo`

- Documentation
  - `README.md` (root) → `readme`
  - `docs/**` or other markdown files → `docs`

### Multi-area changes
- If changes span multiple internal packages, use `internal`
- If changes span commands and internal packages, use the primary area or omit scope
- If changes are broadly cross-cutting (≥3 unrelated areas), use `repo`

## Inputs to use when generating
- The full diff and edit history from this session
- Changed files and their paths to infer scope using the rules above
- Commit messages, branch name, or linked issues if available

If context is insufficient to infer details, choose the best effort scope from filenames and touched areas. Do not ask questions; still produce both blocks.

## Output blocks (exactly two, nothing else)

## Example Output

For a change that adds karabiner configuration support:

```text
feat(app/keyboard): add karabiner configuration support with custom shortcuts
```

```markdown
## Summary
Adds support for installing and configuring Karabiner-Elements with custom keyboard shortcuts. Enables automated setup of complex keyboard modifications during bootstrap.

## Context
Users need to manually configure karabiner after installation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This change automates the configuration process with sensible defaults and customization support.

## Changes
- Add karabiner installation via mas/brew
- Implement karabiner.json configuration generation
- Add keyboard shortcut profile management
- Create default shortcut presets for common workflows
- Integrate with bootstrap command for automated setup

## Implementation notes
- Uses karabiner's JSON configuration format for compatibility
- Provides both default profiles and custom override support
- Configuration stored in `hack/app/keyboard/karabiner/` for version control
- Validates configuration before applying to prevent errors

## Breaking changes
- None

## Test plan
- Built and tested locally with `make local`
- Verified karabiner configuration generation creates valid JSON
- Tested bootstrap integration on fresh macOS installation
- Verified shortcuts work correctly in various applications
- Validated custom override functionality

## Risks
- Low risk: Only affects new karabiner installations
- Configuration errors caught by validation before application
- Users can manually edit config if needed

## Checklist
- [x] Docs updated (if needed)
- [x] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [x] Backward compatible
```
